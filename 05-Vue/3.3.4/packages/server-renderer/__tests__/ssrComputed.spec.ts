// #5208 reported memory leak of keeping computed alive during SSR
// so we made computed properties created during SSR non-reactive in
// https://github.com/vuejs/core/commit/f4f0966b33863ac0fca6a20cf9e8ddfbb311ae87
// However, the default caching leads to #5300 which is tested below.
// In Vue 2, computed properties are simple getters during SSR - this can be
// inefficient if an expensive computed is accessed multiple times during render,
// but because of potential mutations, we cannot cache it until we enter the
// render phase (where no mutations can happen anymore)
