       **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting feature requests. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [docs](https://vuejs.org/)
        - Ask on [Discord Chat](https://chat.vuejs.org/)
        - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions)
        - Look for / ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=vue.js)

        Also try to search for your issue - another user may have already requested something similar!

      label: What problem does this feature solve?
      description: |
        Explain your use case, context, and rationale behind this feature request. More importantly, what is the **end user experience** you are trying to build that led to the need for this feature?

        An important design goal of Vue is keeping the API surface small and straightforward. In general, we only consider adding new features that solve a problem that cannot be easily dealt with using existing APIs (i.e. not just an alternative way of doing things that can already be done). The problem should also be common enough to justify the addition.
